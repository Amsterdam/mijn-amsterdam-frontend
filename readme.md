# Mijn-Amsterdam Front-end

Hi and welcome to the **Mijn-Amsterdam** front-end repository!

This repo is the main codebase for the web application found at [https://mijn.amsterdam.nl](mijn.amsterdam.nl) which
is a portal for official communication with the municipality of Amsterdam.

To see the application quickly running locally, clone the repo and cd into the project folder. Put the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run watch:bff-api
$ npm start
```

### Keypoints

- Typescript SPA
- Boilerplate with `create-react-app`
- Built with `react`
- Uses `scss` for css pre processing
- Uses `css modules` for style composition
- Communication via REST Api

### Development

- Be extra considerate about naming things, discuss with the team if needed. Dutch terms that cannot be easily translated are kept dutch. The rest can be provided in English.
- Write a test when a complex and/or critical component is encountered. We don't require 100% test coverage however...
- Take time to review code. Thorough reviews are a good addition for preventing sloppy code and bugs.
- Try to improve your skills, ask questions, be thoughtful and voice concerns if you have them.

#### Components

Stick to functional react components as much as possible, when you need state within a component
use the hooks api with context provider.

Multiple components/exports per file is ok als long as they are logically grouped and the line count is managable.

A blueprint for basic components can be found in `components/AlphaComponent/`. A blueprint for page components is locataed in `pages/AlphaPage`.
To generate a component based on these blueprints you can either copy/paste rename stuff or use a tool like `npm install -g generact` which can
be used to duplicate any component and assign it a specific name.

### Naming

#### Constants

When creating constants put them in a `Component.constants.js` file. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` naming. e.g:

```
const Things = { FOO: 'Bar', WHY_NOT_THIS_ONE: 'I don\'t like pink' }
```

#### Typescript

- When dealing with more than a few types, create a `*.types.ts` file. This keeps module files more readable.
- Files that include markup are committed with the `.tsx` extension.
- Generic / global types and interfaces can be put in `App.types.ts`.
- Component props are declared in an interface with a `Props` suffix. e.g `ButtonLinkProps`;

#### Styles

- when component name is `MyComponent`, name your css (modules) file `MyComponent.module.css`

It's possible to use css modules in conjunction with `sass` when this is needed, `npm install node-sass`and
rename your module files to `.scss`

### Tooling

- `node` 8.11.2 or higher (find a stable version)
- we use `create-react-app` as boilerplate for the application.
- `prettier`\* is used as code formatting (styling) tool and is set-up as pre-commit hook
- `.editorconfig`\* is used for setting basic file formatting properties

\*You can find a desired plugin for your IDE or editor that use these files for your convience

### Mock Api

We have a mock api which we try to keep up to date with the connections to the real api.
To run the bff-api, run the following command in the console `$ npm run watch:bff-api`. The script depends on `npm install -g nodemon`

Whenever you need to update/add an api look for the correct api mock in `./src/server/mock-data` and make your changes.
The server will restart automatically.

// ENV variables to configure server runtime
HOST=localhost
PORT=3000
BFF_PORT=5000
BFF_HOST=localhost
BFF_DATAPUNT_API_BASE_URL=/api
BFF_MS_API_BASE_URL=/api
BFF_SECURE_COOKIE=false
BFF_DISABLE_MOCK_ADAPTER=false
BFF_SENTRY_DSN=

### Branch naming + PR

- When creating a new branch, preferably, branch off `master`
- When creating a branch, start the name with a ticket number from Jira e.g: `task/mijn-1234-update-logo`
- If you have work for multple tickets in one branch try to reference a parent ticket, for example a story ticket. `story/mijn-5678-create-constant-files`
- When creating a PR/MR put the ticket number between square brackets like: `[mijn-1234] Some title for your PR`
- Keep commit messages compact en meaningful
- Try to squash commits before merging into master.

### Continuous integration / Continuous deployment

We currently work with a trunk based development approach. [see also](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) This means we have relatively short lived branches and only 1 main branch (master)
The master branch should always be production worthy in terms of functionality, stability and code quality.
Every release to production is accompanied with a release tag in the from of: `release-v1.2.3`. Whenever you are about create a release, use the `npm run release:(major|minor|bug)` command. This command
creates a [semver](https://semver.org/) version of the release tag and pushes it to origin. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically detect the tag and starts building a production image.

run e2e tests locally outside of docker by running the `npm run e2:ci` command
run the e2e tests in the docker set-up by running the `docker-compose up --build --exit-code-from e2e e2e` command
run the cypress ui for e2e testing by firing up the api `npm run watch:bff-api` and the build `npm run serve-build` and then `cypress open`

## Docker

- `docker build ./ --tag="mijn-amsterdam"`
- `docker run -p 8080:80 -e LOGOUT_URL=test mijn-amsterdam`


## BFF API response structure and status

The BFF api returns 2 types of actual source content. object | array;
```
const someRealContent = { some: 'content' };
const otherRealContent = [{ other: 'content' }, { other: 'content' }];
```
The BFF api returns `null` content on non-successful statuses (`status !== 'success'`)
```
const nullishContent = null;
```

### ApiSuccessResult`<T>`
```
const SOME_API_STATE_KEY = {
  status: 'success',
  content: T
}
```

### ApiErrorResult
```
const ANOTHER_API_STATE_KEY = {
  status: 'failure',
  content: null,
  message: 'The request failed due to an error in the source api'
}
```

### ApiMixedResult
(data fetched from multiple api's corresponding to 1 main ApiStateKey but can have mixed api responses)
```
const THE_API_STATE_KEY = {
  status: 'mixed',
  content: {
    THINGS: ApiSuccessResult<otherRealContent>, // corresponding error name: THE_API_STATE_KEY_`THINGS`
    ITEMS: ApiErrorResult // corresponding error name: THE_API_STATE_KEY_`ITEMS`
  },
}
```

### ApiUnknownResult
Is returned if a call to source api could not be made due to dependency failure. 
For example if data from api1 needs to be passed to api2 but api1 returns with an error.
```
const API_STATE_KEY_DEP = {
  status: 'dependency-failure',
  content: null
}
```

### ApiPostponeResult
Can be used to postpone fetching to a source api for example if using a feature toggle
```
const API_STATE_KEY_4 = {
  status: 'postpone',
  content: null
}
```

### ApiPristineResult
Can be used to set initial data without having fetched data from a source api
```
const API_STATE_KEY_FOOBAR = {
  status: 'pristine',
  content: null
}

```
